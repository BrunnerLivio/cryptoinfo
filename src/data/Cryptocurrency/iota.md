# tl;dr

High scalability, no mining, no blocks, no difficulty, no transaction fees, Trustless transactions between parties, Freedom of payments, Counterfeiting impossible, Fraud resistant, No single point of failure, No % based transfer costs, free to hold.
Protocol is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) called the tangle instead of the traditional blockchain. Where a blockchain is a linked list where every block points to a unique descendant, in the tangle, a block links to two previous blocks. [[1]](#source-1)

## Seeds

A seed is a unique identifier that can be described as a combined username and password that grants you access to your IOTA.

Your seed is used to generate the addresses and private keys you will use to store and send IOTA, so this should be kept private and not shared with anyone. If anyone obtains your seed, they can generate the private keys associated with your addresses and access your IOTA. [[2]](#source-2)

## Non reusable addresses

Contrary to traditional blockchain based systems such as Bitcoin, where your wallet addresses can be reused, IOTA's addresses should only be used once (for outgoing transfers). That means there is no limit to the number of transactions an address can receive, but as soon as you've used funds from that address to make a transaction, this address should not be used anymore.
